			- lots of stuff such as auth has been moved from app into crates #todo add link
			- real app with xrpc
		- local dev setup?

		- what is postgres for?
			- deduplicating the local copies of repos from pdses (cache)
			- sharing schemas across apps
		- what we learned?
			- rust was a good call
			- no official libraries. started using atrium, but it didn't make it easy to create and work with custom lexicons. so rolled my own client
			- oauth isn't that hard
				- considered starting a tutoring service for auth impl lol
				- just need to understand resource server, protected server, dynamic client registration, dpop, etc
				- #1 question about atp dev is oauth
